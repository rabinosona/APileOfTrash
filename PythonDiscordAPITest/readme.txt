I was trying to learn Python a bit and I thought that it will be nice to try to work with some API from it. Also, I had a lot of undeleted messages in Discord and I thought
that it will be a nice idea to delete them all.
I have used DiscordPy, which uses asyncio, so this program should work in an asynchronous way, but it don't work, as I have a generator and I can't do anything with its con
tents via loop as it seems synchronous. Maybe it is because of lack of experience.
